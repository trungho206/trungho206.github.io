  *Jumping into the age of 21 makes me start thinking more seriously about life. The time that we usually call it "quarter-life crisis", raises many questions to me at the same like what kind of job I would like to do after graduation, what is the specific industry that my knowledge is favored at that moment, what skills have I possessed throughout 4 years and to which level those help me in the future career. These questions pushed me to the point at which I decided to learn whatever it takes to find the most lucrative and earn-most-money job out there. Immediately, the first thought that came up to mind is learning how to code, in specific, is to become a web developer since I found that Japanese company willing to pay a high salary for those acquiring both the Japanese language (N2 or above) and coding. All of these seemed to be a real deal to invest in since I got JLPT N2 and just need to spend intensive 2,3 years mastering coding and then I can nail it someday. At the very beginning stages of researching about it, I found it interesting; however, when it comes to technical aspects I realized it just doesn't fit me at all, or just in another way around. Then, I decided to quit the part-time job on which I devoted 2 years of my university life, just to analyze and re-evaluate myself in an attempt to truly understanding my strengths and weaknesses, instead. Eventually, I settled my mind with a salesman, but at the same time, I will come back to Vietnam and start to open a small class teaching speaking Japanese which I pretty believed in myself, while accumulating and experiencing with Cryptocurrencies Investment. And the last one is the main reason why I created this blog to share my knowledge and at most to receive more advice as well as feedbacks from everyone no matter what you are beginners or "Whales" in this field. Lastly, I hope we can learn from each other a lot from here.*
